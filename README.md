# hello-world
My introduction to the github community. I am looking to collaborate and discuss many projects that will stand to further integrate the online community with the lifestyles of artists, and likeminded individuals across a global basis! Join me my friends, and let us get online, stay connected and create amazing things together!
I am continuing to learn new techniques about coding everyday. I have a passion to drive technology and culture forward. I hope this new commitment edit will gauge interest from my peers. Shoot me a message if you want to involve me in your project!
